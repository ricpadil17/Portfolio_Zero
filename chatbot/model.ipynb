tutorial : hello world !', '.entry-header this tutorial will guide you through the steps of programming a rom which , when run using a gameboy emulator , will write the words “ hello world ” on the screen .', 'the first one , gbhw.inc , attaches names to a load of locations in the gameboy ’ s memory – meaning that we don ’ t have to remember exact addresses for all of this stuff .', 'the gameboy can store and display two different kinds of images : “ tiles ” , which are 8×8 images ; and “ sprites ” , which are either 8×8 pixel images , or 8×16 pixel images .', 'the gameboy can ’ t display anything other than images – there ’ s no text output – so any writing we ’ re storing has to be displayed as images .', 'tiles the gameboy draws its graphics to a “ buffer ” , which is then displayed on the screen .', 'there are multiple buffers used by the gameboy , but the one we ’ ll be worrying about is the background tile buffer .', 'because the gameboy only has a 160×144 pixel screen , this means that only part of the background can be displayed at a time .', 'they ’ re there because of a particularly important concept in gameboy programming , called interrupts .', \"setting up the rom header the next bit of code after that is this : section `` start '' , home [ $ 0100 ] nop jp begin rom_headerrom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , ram_size_0kbyte on startup , the first thing an actual gameboy does is execute a small ( 256 byte ) program , which reads the memory locations from $ 100 to $ 14d – an area also known as the ‘ rom header ’ – and uses the information there to perform various bits of setup , which i won ’ t go into too much detail about here because it ’ s not particularly important for this program .\", 'the three arguments we ’ ve put in to that macro , rom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , and ram_size_0kbyte , tell the gameboy that our rom is just a simple , 32 kilobyte rom – 32 kilobytes is the minimum size for a gameboy rom .', 'the first part , the ‘ mnemonic ’ , tells the gameboy what kind of instruction it ’ s executing , while if there are more parts then those are the ‘ arguments ’ or ‘ parameters , which are bits of data the instruction uses .', 'in other words , the mnemonic tells the gameboy what to do , and the parameters tell the gameboy what to do stuff to .', 'it ’ s a ‘ no-op ’ instruction : all the gameboy does is wait for 4 cpu cycles , before moving on to the next thing .', 'what it does is set the stack pointer to $ ffff , which is one more than the highest memory address the gameboy can access .', 'the ‘ stack ’ is the bit of memory the gameboy uses to store things when it ’ s running , including arguments , variables , and return addresses – this is something it has in common with most processors .', 'there are two things the gameboy can do with the stack – it can ‘ push ’ a piece of data onto it , and it can ‘ pop ’ the last bit of data added to the stack and use it .', 'setting the stack pointer higher than where the gameboy can access might seem counter-intuitive , but it ’ s because of how the gameboy pushes values onto the stack .', 'when a gameboy pushes a piece of data onto the stack , it performs two operations : it subtracts 1 from the stack pointer .', 'to explain that , let ’ s take a look at the gameboy ’ s cpu .', 'like any cpu , a gameboy cpu has several ‘ registers ’ , which are parts of the processor that can store a value so it can be accessed quickly later on .', 'the gameboy has eight 8-bit registers , which can store values up to 255 , called a , b , c , d , e , f , h and l. there are also two 16-bit registers , called sp and pc .', '$ ff47 is the memory location that stores the background tile palette , which are the shades of grey used by the gameboy when it draws its graphics .', 'so , first , we make sure that wherever we ’ re pulling tile data from actually has the tiles in it , like so : ldhl , tiledata next , we set up de so that it ’ s storing the location in ram where tile memory starts on a gameboy .', 'it should then compile and link , and your shiny new rom will appear in the same folder , ready to be run in whatever emulator you like ( provided that it runs gameboy games , anyway ) .', 'a lot of it was also borrowed from the sample code john harrison wrote for a course in gameboy programming at wichita state university – you can see more about that here .', 'links a course in gameboy programming at wichita state university .', 'everything you always wanted to know about gameboy : a complete gameboy specification , including info about

run using a gameboy emulator , will write the words “ hello world ” on the screen .', 'the first one , gbhw.inc , attaches names to a load of locations in the gameboy ’ s memory – meaning that we don ’ t have to remember exact addresses for all of this stuff .', 'the gameboy can store and display two different kinds of images : “ tiles ” , which are 8×8 images ; and “ sprites ” , which are either 8×8 pixel images , or 8×16 pixel images .', 'the gameboy can ’ t display anything other than images – there ’ s no text output – so any writing we ’ re storing has to be displayed as images .', 'tiles the gameboy draws its graphics to a “ buffer ” , which is then displayed on the screen .', 'there are multiple buffers used by the gameboy , but the one we ’ ll be worrying about is the background tile buffer .', 'because the gameboy only has a 160×144 pixel screen , this means that only part of the background can be displayed at a time .', 'they ’ re there because of a particularly important concept in gameboy programming , called interrupts .', \"setting up the rom header the next bit of code after that is this : section `` start '' , home [ $ 0100 ] nop jp begin rom_headerrom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , ram_size_0kbyte on startup , the first thing an actual gameboy does is execute a small ( 256 byte ) program , which reads the memory locations from $ 100 to $ 14d – an area also known as the ‘ rom header ’ – and uses the information there to perform various bits of setup , which i won ’ t go into too much detail about here because it ’ s not particularly important for this program .\", 'the three arguments we ’ ve put in to that macro , rom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , and ram_size_0kbyte , tell the gameboy that our rom is just a simple , 32 kilobyte rom – 32 kilobytes is the minimum size for a gameboy rom .', 'the first part , the ‘ mnemonic ’ , tells the gameboy what kind of instruction it ’ s executing , while if there are more parts then those are the ‘ arguments ’ or ‘ parameters , which are bits of data the instruction uses .', 'in other words , the mnemonic tells the gameboy what to do , and the parameters tell the gameboy what to do stuff to .', 'it ’ s a ‘ no-op ’ instruction : all the gameboy does is wait for 4 cpu cycles , before moving on to the next thing .', 'what it does is set the stack pointer to $ ffff , which is one more than the highest memory address the gameboy can access .', 'the ‘ stack ’ is the bit of memory the gameboy uses to store things when it ’ s running , including arguments , variables , and return addresses – this is something it has in common with most processors .', 'there are two things the gameboy can do with the stack – it can ‘ push ’ a piece of data onto it , and it can ‘ pop ’ the last bit of data added to the stack and use it .', 'setting the stack pointer higher than where the gameboy can access might seem counter-intuitive , but it ’ s because of how the gameboy pushes values onto the stack .', 'when a gameboy pushes a piece of data onto the stack , it performs two operations : it subtracts 1 from the stack pointer .', 'to explain that , let ’ s take a look at the gameboy ’ s cpu .', 'like any cpu , a gameboy cpu has several ‘ registers ’ , which are parts of the processor that can store a value so it can be accessed quickly later on .', 'the gameboy has eight 8-bit registers , which can store values up to 255 , called a , b , c , d , e , f , h and l. there are also two 16-bit registers , called sp and pc .', '$ ff47 is the memory location that stores the background tile palette , which are the shades of grey used by the gameboy when it draws its graphics .', 'so , first , we make sure that wherever we ’ re pulling tile data from actually has the tiles in it , like so : ldhl , tiledata next , we set up de so that it ’ s storing the location in ram where tile memory starts on a gameboy .', 'it should then compile and link , and your shiny new rom will appear in the same folder , ready to be run in whatever emulator you like ( provided that it runs gameboy games , anyway ) .', 'a lot of it was also borrowed from the sample code john harrison wrote for a course in gameboy

masthead gameboy programming tutorial : hello world !', '.entry-header this tutorial will guide you through the steps of programming a rom which , when run using a gameboy emulator , will write the words “ hello world ” on the screen .', 'the code in this tutorial will all be the assembly language used by the game boy processor , which is a slightly modified version of the zilog z80 .', 'i also found a vim syntax highlighting file for game boy assembler , which you can download from here .', 'the first one , gbhw.inc , attaches names to a load of locations in the gameboy ’ s memory – meaning that we don ’ t have to remember exact addresses for all of this stuff .', 'the reason we need our letters as tiles is because of how the game boy stores and displays graphics .', 'the gameboy can store and display two different kinds of images : “ tiles ” , which are 8×8 images ; and “ sprites ” , which are either 8×8 pixel images , or 8×16 pixel images .', 'the gameboy can ’ t display anything other than images – there ’ s no text output – so any writing we ’ re storing has to be displayed as images .', 'tiles the gameboy draws its graphics to a “ buffer ” , which is then displayed on the screen .', 'there are multiple buffers used by the gameboy , but the one we ’ ll be worrying about is the background tile buffer .', 'because the gameboy only has a 160×144 pixel screen , this means that only part of the background can be displayed at a time .', 'they ’ re there because of a particularly important concept in gameboy programming , called interrupts .', \"setting up the rom header the next bit of code after that is this : section `` start '' , home [ $ 0100 ] nop jp begin rom_headerrom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , ram_size_0kbyte on startup , the first thing an actual gameboy does is execute a small ( 256 byte ) program , which reads the memory locations from $ 100 to $ 14d – an area also known as the ‘ rom header ’ – and uses the information there to perform various bits of setup , which i won ’ t go into too much detail about here because it ’ s not particularly important for this program .\", 'the three arguments we ’ ve put in to that macro , rom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , and ram_size_0kbyte , tell the gameboy that our rom is just a simple , 32 kilobyte rom – 32 kilobytes is the minimum size for a gameboy rom .', 'the first part , the ‘ mnemonic ’ , tells the gameboy what kind of instruction it ’ s executing , while if there are more parts then those are the ‘ arguments ’ or ‘ parameters , which are bits of data the instruction uses .', 'in other words , the mnemonic tells the gameboy what to do , and the parameters tell the gameboy what to do stuff to .', 'it ’ s a ‘ no-op ’ instruction : all the gameboy does is wait for 4 cpu cycles , before moving on to the next thing .', 'what it does is set the stack pointer to $ ffff , which is one more than the highest memory address the gameboy can access .', 'the ‘ stack ’ is the bit of memory the gameboy uses to store things when it ’ s running , including arguments , variables , and return addresses – this is something it has in common with most processors .', 'there are two things the gameboy can do with the stack – it can ‘ push ’ a piece of data onto it , and it can ‘ pop ’ the last bit of data added to the stack and use it .', 'setting the stack pointer higher than where the gameboy can access might seem counter-intuitive , but it ’ s because of how the gameboy pushes values onto the stack .', 'when a gameboy pushes a piece of data onto the stack , it performs two operations : it subtracts 1 from the stack pointer .', 'to explain that , let ’ s take a look at the gameboy ’ s cpu .', 'like any cpu , a gameboy cpu has several ‘ registers ’ , which are parts of the processor that can store a value so it can be accessed quickly later on .', 'the gameboy has eight 8-bit registers , which can store values up to 255 , called a , b , c , d , e , f , h and l. there are also two 16-bit registers , called sp and pc .', '$ ff47 is the memory location that stores the background tile palette , which are the shades of grey used by the gameboy when it draws its graphics .', 'so , first , we make sure that wherever we ’ re pulling tile data from actually has the tiles in it , like so : ldhl , tiledata next , we set up de so that it ’ s storing the location in ram where tile memory starts on a gameboy .', 'it should then compile and link , and your shiny new rom will appear in the same folder , ready to be run in whatever emulator you like ( provided that it runs gameboy games , anyway ) .', 'a lot of it was also borrowed from the sample code john harrison wrote for a course in gameboy programming at wichita state university – you can see more about that here .', 'links a course in gameboy programming at wichita state university .', 'everything you always wanted to know about gameboy : a complete gameboy specification , including info about

tutorial will guide you through the steps of programming a rom which , when run using a gameboy emulator , will write the words “ hello world ” on the screen .', 'the code in this tutorial will all be the assembly language used by the game boy processor , which is a slightly modified version of the zilog z80 .', 'i also found a vim syntax highlighting file for game boy assembler , which you can download from here .', 'the first one , gbhw.inc , attaches names to a load of locations in the gameboy ’ s memory – meaning that we don ’ t have to remember exact addresses for all of this stuff .', 'the reason we need our letters as tiles is because of how the game boy stores and displays graphics .', 'the gameboy can store and display two different kinds of images : “ tiles ” , which are 8×8 images ; and “ sprites ” , which are either 8×8 pixel images , or 8×16 pixel images .', 'the gameboy can ’ t display anything other than images – there ’ s no text output – so any writing we ’ re storing has to be displayed as images .', 'tiles the gameboy draws its graphics to a “ buffer ” , which is then displayed on the screen .', 'there are multiple buffers used by the gameboy , but the one we ’ ll be worrying about is the background tile buffer .', 'because the gameboy only has a 160×144 pixel screen , this means that only part of the background can be displayed at a time .', 'they ’ re there because of a particularly important concept in gameboy programming , called interrupts .', \"setting up the rom header the next bit of code after that is this : section `` start '' , home [ $ 0100 ] nop jp begin rom_headerrom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , ram_size_0kbyte on startup , the first thing an actual gameboy does is execute a small ( 256 byte ) program , which reads the memory locations from $ 100 to $ 14d – an area also known as the ‘ rom header ’ – and uses the information there to perform various bits of setup , which i won ’ t go into too much detail about here because it ’ s not particularly important for this program .\", 'the three arguments we ’ ve put in to that macro , rom_nombc , rom_size_32kbyte , and ram_size_0kbyte , tell the gameboy that our rom is just a simple , 32 kilobyte rom – 32 kilobytes is the minimum size for a gameboy rom .', 'the first part , the ‘ mnemonic ’ , tells the gameboy what kind of instruction it ’ s executing , while if there are more parts then those are the ‘ arguments ’ or ‘ parameters , which are bits of data the instruction uses .', 'in other words , the mnemonic tells the gameboy what to do , and the parameters tell the gameboy what to do stuff to .', 'it ’ s a ‘ no-op ’ instruction : all the gameboy does is wait for 4 cpu cycles , before moving on to the next thing .', 'what it does is set the stack pointer to $ ffff , which is one more than the highest memory address the gameboy can access .', 'the ‘ stack ’ is the bit of memory the gameboy uses to store things when it ’ s running , including arguments , variables , and return addresses – this is something it has in common with most processors .', 'there are two things the gameboy can do with the stack – it can ‘ push ’ a piece of data onto it , and it can ‘ pop ’ the last bit of data added to the stack and use it .', 'setting the stack pointer higher than where the gameboy can access might seem counter-intuitive , but it ’ s because of how the gameboy pushes values onto the stack .', 'when a gameboy pushes a piece of data onto the stack , it performs two operations : it subtracts 1 from the stack pointer .', 'to explain that , let ’ s take a look at the gameboy ’ s cpu .', 'like any cpu , a gameboy cpu has several ‘ registers ’ , which are parts of the processor that can store a value so it can be accessed quickly later on .', 'the gameboy has eight 8-bit registers , which can store values up to 255 , called a , b , c , d , e , f , h and l. there are also two 16-bit registers , called sp and pc .', '$ ff47 is the memory location that stores the background tile palette , which are the shades of grey used by the gameboy when it draws its graphics .', 'so , first , we make sure that wherever we ’ re pulling tile data from actually has the tiles in it , like so : ldhl , tiledata next , we set up de so that it ’ s storing the location in ram where tile memory starts on a gameboy .', 'it should then compile and link , and your shiny new rom will appear in the same folder , ready to be run in whatever emulator you like ( provided that it runs gameboy games , anyway ) .', 'a lot of it was also borrowed from the sample

rather boring… .', 'crayon syntax highlighter v_2.7.2_beta c score [ 0 ] = 9 ; score [ 1 ] = 0 ; score [ 2 ] = 0 ; score [ 3 ] = 1 ; 1 2 3 4 score [ 0 ] = 9 ; score [ 1 ] = 0 ; score [ 2 ] = 0 ; score [ 3 ] = 1 ; [ format time : 0.0007 seconds ] in a game i ’ m making currently , scores can extend beyond the limits of a 16 bit integer also , so we ’ re using slighlty longer arrays to store things in , no biggie .', 'i ’ ve found a handy solution to my problem , along the lines of the following : crayon syntax highlighter v_2.7.2_beta c //set up our test scoreshiscore1 [ 0 ] = 0 ; hiscore1 [ 1 ] = 0 ; hiscore1 [ 2 ] = 9 ; hiscore1 [ 3 ] = 6 ; hiscore1 [ 4 ] = 9 ; hiscore1 [ 5 ] = 9 ; score [ 0 ] = 0 ; score [ 1 ] = 0 ; score [ 2 ] = 6 ; score [ 3 ] = 9 ; score [ 4 ] = 9 ; score [ 5 ] = 9 ; higher = 10 ; // 10 = same score , 0 = lower than highscore , 20 = higher than highscorei = 0 ; while ( higher == 10 ) { if ( hiscore1 [ i ] > score [ i ] ) { higher = 0 ; } if ( hiscore1 [ i ] < score [ i ] ) { higher = 20 ; } if ( hiscore1 [ i ] == score [ i ] ) { higher = 10 ; } if ( i == 5 ) { break ; } i++ ; } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 //set up our test scores hiscore1 [ 0 ] = 0 ; hiscore1 [ 1 ] = 0 ; hiscore1 [ 2 ] = 9 ; hiscore1 [ 3 ] = 6 ; hiscore1 [ 4 ] = 9 ; hiscore1 [ 5 ] = 9 ; score [ 0 ] = 0 ; score [ 1 ] = 0 ; score [ 2 ] = 6 ;

seconds ] what the code above does is compare the arrays on an integer by integer basis and set another variable with the result , reliably !', 'i hope this helps someone out there who has a similar
